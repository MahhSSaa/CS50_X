Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations like when N = 10, the prediction about winner team is incorret .

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 simulations so this numbor of simiulation is "good enough".
