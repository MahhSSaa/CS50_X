Question :
    If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer :
    1- Speechiness : One of the features I use to characterize songs is speechiness, which measures the presence of spoken words or lyrics in a song.
       By calculating the average speechiness for the top 100 songs, we can assess the level of lyrical content in the listener's music.

    2- Loudness : Another feature I utilize to characterize songs is loudness, which measures the overall volume of a songs.
       Analyzing the average loudness can provide insights into whether the listener's top songs tend to be louder or quieter in nature.

    3- Tempo : The third feature I employ for this purpose is Tempo, which indicates the speed or tempo of songs and is measured in BPM(beats per minutes).
       By calculating the average tempo of the top 100 songs, we can comprehend the overall tempo preference of the listener

Question :
    Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
    What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer:
    The method of calculating an "audio aura" based on average audio features is not representative because:
    * People have diverse musical tastes and averages oversimplify emotions. 
    * Music's emotional impact is subjective and personal and can be influenced by the listener's mood
    * Statistical results based on digits can be skewed by outliers..
    * It is important to consider context, as songs are often experienced in sequences.

    To improve my suggestion is :
    * Emotion analysis: Instead of solely focusing on audio features, use natural language processing to analyze songs' lyrics, comments, and reviews.
      This can help capture the emotional content of the music more accurately.

    * Genre and Artist analysis: This can provide insight into the listener's musical preferences and emotional associations.

    * Playlist analysis: Analyze the structure and order of songs on the listening playlist.

    * Contextual analysis: Explore how and when listeners listen to specific songs, such as during exercise, relaxation, or work.
      Also, analyze at what time of day or month they listen to certain songs

    * Interactive Apps: Develop interactive apps or tools that allow listeners to directly express their emotions or moods associated with specific songs or playlists.
